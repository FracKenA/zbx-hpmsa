zbx-hpmsa provides possibility to make Low Level Discovery of HPE MSA storage components via it's XML API. Also it can get health status of discovered component.  
Program wrote with Python 3.6.3, but works with Python 3.4.4 from CentOS (I didn't check it with earlier versions, sorry).  

**Latest stable version:** 0.3

## Dependencies
 - requests
 - lxml (experimental, may be replaced with 'xml' from Python stdlib)

**Feautres**  
Common:
 - [x] Bulk requests for dependent items of Zabbix 3.4
 - [x] Session key cache (MSA login cache)
 - [x] HTTPS support (with limitations, look relevant section in Wiki)

Low Level Discovery:
 - [x] physical disks 
 - [x] virtual disks
 - [x] controllers
 - [x] Enclosures

Component status:
 - [x] physical disks 
 - [x] virtual disks
 - [x] controllers
 - [x] Enclosures

## TODO
- [ ] HTTPS support

## Supported arguments  
**-m|--msa**  
HPE MSA DNS name or IP address.  
**-u|--user**  
Sets MSA username  
**-p|--password**  
Sets password for MSA user  
**-d|--discovery**  
Enables discovery mode.  
**-c|--component**  
Sets component to request.  
**-g|--get**  
**-v|--version**  
Prints script version and exit.  

## Usage
- LLD of enclosures, controllers, virtual disks and physical disks:
```bash
[user@server ~] # ./zbx-hpmsa.py --discovery --msa MSA-NAME-OR-IP --component vdisks

{"data":[{"{#VDISKNAME}":"vDisk01"},{"{#VDISKNAME}":"vDisk02"}]}
```
- Request health status of one component. E.g. disk '1.1':
```bash
[user@server ~] # ./zbx-hpmsa.py --msa MSA-NAME-OR-IP --component disks --get 1.1

OK
```
- Bulk request to get all available data. E.g. all disks or controller 'A':
```bash
[user@server ~] # ./zbx-hpmsa.py --msa MSA-NAME-OR-IP --component disks --get all
{"1.1":{"health":"OK","temperature":"25","work_hours":"21170"},"1.2":{"health":"OK","temperature":"24","work_hours":"21168"}, ...}
[user@server ~] # ./zbx-hpmsa.py --msa MSA-NAME-OR-IP --component controllers --get all
{"A":{"health":"OK","cf_health":"OK","ports":{"A1":{"health":"OK","status":"Up","sfp_status":"OK"},"A2":{"health":"OK","status":"Up","sfp_status":"OK"},"A3":{"health":"N/A","status":"Disconnected","sfp_status":"Not present"},"A4":{"health":"N/A","status":"Disconnected","sfp_status":"Not present"}}},"B":{"health":"OK","cf_health":"OK","ports":{"B1":{"health":"OK","status":"Up","sfp_status":"OK"},"B2":{"health":"OK","status":"Up","sfp_status":"OK"},"B3":{"health":"N/A","status":"Disconnected","sfp_status":"Not present"},"B4":{"health":"N/A","status":"Disconnected","sfp_status":"Not present"}}}}
```

## Zabbix templates
In addition I've attached preconfigured Zabbix Template here, so you can use it in your environment. It's using Low Level Discovery functionality
and {HOST.CONN} macro to determine HTTP connection URL, so make sure that it points to right DNS name or IP. This template expects what your MSA storage
has default user with default password - **'monitor'@'!monitor'**, but if it isn't true - correct it with '-u' and '-p' options. You can check it it command line:
```bash
[user@server ~] # ./zbx-hpmsa.py --msa MSA-NAME-OR-IP --component disks --get all --user FOO --password BAR
```  
Have fun and rate it on [share.zabbix.com](https://share.zabbix.com/component/mtree/storage-devices/hp/hp-msa-2040-xml-api) if you like it. =)

**Tested with**:  
HP MSA 2040

**Known Issues**:
- Sometimes appears the error "The user is not recognized on this system" though username and password are correct.
  - Fixed in 0.2.5.2 and higher.
